# updater
This is a little script I use in various forms to keep Debian 
and Ubuntu machines up to date.

I usually put it in /usr/local/bin.

To keep multiple machines up to date I either set a cron
job to run regularly or use cluster ssh to connect to various
machines and run 'sudo update' on them.

This can be taylored to the individual machines as needed so
that the same command does what I want it to.
